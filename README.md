# Snake Way

This is a game based on the journey to get to the King Kai's planet. 
Goku will help you to get there but you must be in a good shape. 
To get that you need to face Enemies and run a long way. 
Follow these simple rules and you won't have any trouble:
 - Every time you run to another Field, you'll advance 1 position.
 - Every time you jump to another Field, you'll advance 3 positions.
 - You must advance at least 25 positions to get to the planet.
 - Jumping will make you vulnerable to enemies, and they will appear more frequently.
 - Fighting is about Strength and luck, if you have more strength than the enemy, will be easier to defeat him.
 - If you feel that you're no match for an enemy, you might run. Running is about Speed and luck, if you have more speed than an enemy, will be easier to flee.
 - At the beginning of the game you can choose your name and attributes. The attributes will be generated randomly, but if you don't like them, you may try again.
 - If you defeat enough enemies Goku will take you to King Kai's with instant transmission. But you'll need at least 20 points of experience.
 - The way to gain experience is defeating enemies. Every enemy has his own amount of given experience, be aware of that. 
 
 Most of all, have fun!!!
